# Purpose

This website holds the information for The 15th Swedish Economic History Meeting to be held in Lund in 2023.

## Planning

What needs to be done?

### Organization

- Decide on venues and update map and colours
- Update programme
- Registration (google forms?)
- Propose a session (google forms?)

### Abstracts

- Find a nice way to format session abstracts
- Is a combined pdf the best way?

### Website

- Set up a contact us email address
- Buy a URL? Ask Gothenberg if we can use [ekonomiskhistoria.org](https://ekonomiskhistoria.org/)

## Website update process

The plan is that you will be able to update the important parts of the website by only editing an excel sheet.

The sheet is stored on github called `programme`.

It looks like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/programme_sheet.PNG"))
```

You can download this from github [here](https://github.com/j-jayes/SEHM-23/raw/main/programme/programme.xlsx), update it on your computer, and then either add it back to github or email it to me.

Then the website will update and include all of the new information!
