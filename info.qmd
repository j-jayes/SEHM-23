The Department of Economic History, School of Economics and Management, Lund University, on behalf of the Scandinavian Society for Economic and Social History and the Swedish Economic History Society hereby invite scholars to the joint fifteenth biannual Swedish Economic History Meeting and the fourth annual Conference of the Scandinavian Society for Economic and Social History. 

The Swedish Economic History Meeting is established as an important forum for collaboration and dialogue amongst economic historians in Sweden and increasingly for colleagues from other Scandinavian countries and beyond. It is widely attended by PhD candidates as well as established researchers. As in Gothenburg in 2021, this meeting is jointly organized as an All-Nordic conference. We hope that the conference will attract broad international participation. 

The conference mainly consists of parallel working panels composed around proposals from contributors and prospective attendants from all over Scandinavia. A wide range of subject matters will be discussed. There will also be keynote presentations and special opportunities for doctoral students to present their thesis projects. Moreover, there will be administrative meetings for Heads of Departments and Director of studies, and for the national and Scandinavian Economic history associations. 

Please refer to [programme](programme.qmd) page for an updated list of accepted panels and paper presentations.
