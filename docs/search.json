    "text": "The Department of Economic History, School of Economics and Management, Lund University, on behalf of the Scandinavian Society for Economic and Social History and the Swedish Economic History Society hereby invite scholars to the joint fifteenth biannual Swedish Economic History Meeting and the fourth annual Conference of the Scandinavian Society for Economic and Social History.\nThe Swedish Economic History Meeting is established as an important forum for collaboration and dialogue amongst economic historians in Sweden and increasingly for colleagues from other Scandinavian countries and beyond. It is widely attended by PhD candidates as well as established researchers. As in Gothenburg in 2021, this meeting is jointly organized as an All-Nordic conference. We hope that the conference will attract broad international participation.\nThe conference mainly consists of parallel working panels composed around proposals from contributors and prospective attendants from all over Scandinavia. A wide range of subject matters will be discussed. There will also be keynote presentations and special opportunities for doctoral students to present their thesis projects. Moreover, there will be administrative meetings for Heads of Departments and Director of studies, and for the national and Scandinavian Economic history associations.\nPlease refer to programme page for an updated list of accepted panels and paper presentations.\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact us here"

It closes on October 1.\n\nRegistration dates\nRegistration is open until\n\n\nWhat is the scope for digital attendance?\nA few of the venues have nice cameras…\nWe have received many questions about online participation. This conference cannot be a so-called hybrid conference. The reason is that the lecture halls do not offer the necessary equipment allowing interactions between online participants and those in the lecture halls.\nThose who are in Lund but wish to participate in a panel that is a zoom meeting do so through their own laptops. There is no registration fee attached to online (only) participation. But for the record we urge all participants, whether going to Lund or organizing only a zoom meeting, to register for the conference. In the registration form, choose “I will attend online only”. Please remember to book your accommodation\n\n\nRegistration form\nYou can access the registration form here"
